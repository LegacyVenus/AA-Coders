				<h1>Muffins, the early years</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>Hi. My name is Muffins.I am a mighty
cat. I was adopted by my family when I was
only three weeks old.
<p>My new mommy is a human. They are funny
creatures.</p>
<p>I left the pound with my new mommy and
new sister, Maria. They took me straight to
the pet store to buy:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A kitty baby bottle and formula</li>
	<li>A small cloth toy</li>
	<li>Food (for later)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mom and sis had to feed me by bottle
because I was so young.</p>
